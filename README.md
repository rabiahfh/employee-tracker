 ## Description 
  
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces  known as a Content Management System. CMS's make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases.  In this interface I created and built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

 ## Installation
  
 ðŸ’¾ 
  
* npm init
  
* npm install express
* npm install inquirer
    
 ## Usage
 

 This  Functional command-line application allows the users to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

<br>
<br>
LANGUAGES USED ARE:
<br>

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- NODE.JS



How do you deliver this?:

* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
